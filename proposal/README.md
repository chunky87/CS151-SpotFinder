## Problem Statement
New food spots and locations are always a place of interest in peopleâ€™s everyday lives, and they may not know any good places/restaurants/viewpoints to enjoy in their local area. Instead of endlessly searching on the internet or spam texting friends for locations, "Spot Finder" offers a convenient solution.

## Description of Functionality

Users can search for spots, read reviews and ratings, and follow friends. The integration of mapping services and community engagement will enhance user experience.
