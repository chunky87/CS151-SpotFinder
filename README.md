# Problem Statement
New food spots and locations are always a place of interest in peopleâ€™s everyday lives, and they may not know any good places/restaurants/viewpoints to enjoy in their local area. Instead of endlessly searching on the internet or spam texting friends for locations, "Spot Finder" offers a convenient solution.
